# Support to render PlantUML diagrams in the Author visual editing mode

This plugin allows the Author visual editing mode to render PlantUML diagrams embedded in DITA topics.

To install, you can download a zip of the entire **wsaccess-javascript-sample-plugins** project, then copy the folder "plantuml-images-support" to the Oxygen **plugins** folder and restart Oxygen. You can later open the **testDiagram.dita** sample topic in the Oxygen editing area to see if the diagrams are properly rendered in the Author visual editing mode.

Double clicking the diagram image will show a dialog box that contains the original diagram text content that can be edited.
